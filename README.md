# Comparing aerial counts and camera trap RAI 

I was interested in comparing aerial count detections to camera trap detections in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique during the same period (late dry season of 2016). I was curious to see which species were more commonly detected in one vs. the other, and how the ratio of aerial to camera trap detections varied across habitats and species.

All exploratory! To revisit once we have 2018 camera trap data, and associated group sizes for the camera trap detections.
